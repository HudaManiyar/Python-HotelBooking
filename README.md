# PYTHON: HOTEL BOOKING CANCELLATION ANALYSIS 

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Booking cancellations disrupt accurate revenue forecasts and management in the hospitality industry. Strict cancellation policies and overbooking can harm revenue, reputation, and customer satisfaction. Overbooking may lead to denied service, while rigid policies, especially non-refundable ones, can deter bookings and necessitate significant discounts to attract guests.

This project examines a dataset featuring City and Resort hotels, focusing on rising cancellation rates causing revenue decline and room underutilization. The primary objective is to reduce cancellations to enhance revenue. The report analyzes booking cancellations and related factors impacting business and annual revenue indirectly.
